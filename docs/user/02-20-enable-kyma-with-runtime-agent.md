# Enable Kyma with Runtime Agent

[Runtime Agent](00-30-runtime-agent-overview.md) is a part of the Application Connector module that is used in the [Compass mode](README.md) of Application Connectivity. 
By default, Kyma uses the [standalone Application Connectivity mode](README.md), which does not support integration with Compass.
