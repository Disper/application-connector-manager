# ApplicationConnector CustomResourceDefinition (CRD)

The applicationconnectors.operator.kyma-project.io CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) is a comprehensive specification that defines the structure and format used to manage the configuration and status of the Application Connector Module within your Kyma environment.

# Purpose

The CRD serves as the blueprint for creating custom resources (CRs) specific to Application Connectors. These CRs encapsulate the configuration settings and real-time statuses of the Application Connector Module, providing essential insights into the module's behavior on the Kubernetes cluster.

To get the up-to-date CRD and show the output in the `yaml` format, run this command:

```bash
kubectl get crd applicationconnectors.operator.kyma-project.io -o yaml
```

## Custom resource specification

| Path | Description | Required |
| ---- | ----------- | -------- |
| domainName | The name of the domain that will be used by the virtual service and gateway resources. On gardener cluster this field is autopopulated. | false |
| appConnValidator.logLevel | Determines the level of verbosity or detail for logging messages generated by __central application connector validator__; one of `debug`, `panic`, `fatal`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug` | false |
| appConnValidator.logFormat | Allows to specify the format in which log messages are generated by the __central application connectivity validator__; one of: `json`, `text`  | false |
| appGateway.logLevel | Determines the level of verbosity or detail for logging messages generated by __central application gateway__; one of `debug`, `panic`, `fatal`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug` | false |
| appGateway.proxyTimeout | Specifies the maximum duration, for which the __central application gateway__ will wait for a response from a external system before timing out | false |
| appGateway.requestTimeout | Specifies the maximum duration, for which the __central application gateway__ will wait for a response from a client request before timing out. | false |
